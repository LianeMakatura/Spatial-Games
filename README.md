# Spatial-Games
Simulation of evolutionary game dynamics on a spatial grid

# Installation
This program depends on Python 3, PySide, and PyQt5. If you are using a Mac, you can install these programs through the terminal using brew:
```
brew install python3
brew install pyside
brew install pyqt5
```
**NOTE:**
The PySide library for python3 on Windows is not yet fully developed, so this program will not work. It may be possible to run it
using Python 2.7 and the corresponding version of PySide, but this has not been tested.

Clone this directory into a local repository, and it should be ready to go!

#Running
Run the file `Colony_GUI.py`.

If you would like to change any of the default values for parameters, you may do so in the file `colonyParams.py`. 

For a full description of the project and parameter values, please see the accompanying paper.
